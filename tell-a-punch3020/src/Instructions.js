                    Welcome, and thank you for playing Tell-A-Punch 3020!

                    <h4>
                    For now, Tell-A-Punch 3020 is a 2-player game only, and has
                    controller and keyboard support.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                    This game is still in development and we may add single player
                    gameplay/online gameplay in the future.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                    This is a turn based fighting game in which players enter
                    key/button combos to attack, or defend incoming attacks. Player 1
                    has access to the keys 1, 2, 3, 4, q, w, e, and r, and Player 2
                    has access to 7, 8, 9, 0, u, i, o, and p. Input from either player
                    correlates to standardized controller button displays A, B, X, Y,
                    down, right, left, and up. Tell-A-Punch 3020 has a few key
                    elements that come into play. Let's start with the health and time
                    bars.
                    </p>
                </div>
              <div className="instructions_combo_div">
                <p className="combo_p">
                    In the center, between both figters, there
                    are 3 combo bars. There are combo bars for
                    each player, as well as one in the center,
                    which is filled with the attacking input of
                    either player on the attack phase.
                    Entering keys or buttons on your turn will 
                    enter inputs into your combo bar. Once the
                    bar has been filled, press any other key or
                    button to end the phase and/or turn.
                    After an attack has been entered, the combo
                    will appear in the center bar and a randomly
                    selected combo mutation will occur, and must
                    be interpereted by the following player in
                    the defending phase to avoid damage.
                    The reverse combo mutation means the combo 
                    must be pressed in the opposite order.
                    The inverted combo mutation means the input
                    of each key must be the opposite, so A = Y,
                    B = X, Up = Down, and Left = Right.
                    The nth is xth mutation switches 2 inputs at
                    corresponding places in the combo, such as
                    1st is 3rd, or 5th is 2nd.
                </p>

                        Both players have a health bar, which takes damage upon
                        unsuccessful defending phases. When your health is damaged,
                        you will hear an indicating sound as well. You start with 10
                        health points, and reaching 0 will spell defeat for you, so
                        take care to defend precisely, and make sure to attack with
                        confusing patterns.

                        Both players have a time bar that continually runs out while
                        their turn is active. When time is low, you will hear a
                        ticking sound. Reaching 0 will mean victory for the opposing
                        player, so make your moves quickly!
