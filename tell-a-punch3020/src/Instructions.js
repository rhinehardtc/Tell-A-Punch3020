                <h3 className="greeting">Welcome, and thank you for playing Tell-A-Punch 3020!</h3>
                <h4>For now, Tell-A-Punch 3020 is a 2-player game only, and has controller and keyboard support.</h4>
                <h4>This game is still in development and we may add single player gameplay/online gameplay in the future.</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a turn based fighting game in which players enter key/button combos to attack, or defend incoming attacks.
                    Player 1 has access to the keys 1, 2, 3, 4, q, w, e, and r, and Player 2 has access to 7, 8, 9, 0, u, i, o, and p.
                    Input from either player correlates to standardized controller button displays A, B, X, Y, down, right, left, and up.
                    Tell-A-Punch 3020 has a few key elements that come into play. Let's start with the health and time bars.
                </p>
                <div className="demo_health_&_time_div">
                    <div className="instructions_time_div">
                        <p className="time_p">
                            Both players have a time bar that continually
                            runs out while their turn is active.
                            When time is low, you will hear a ticking sound.
                            Reaching 0 will mean victory for the
                            opposing player, so make your moves quickly!
                        </p>
                        <TimeBar time={2500} p1={true}/>
                    </div>
                    <div className="instructions_health_div">
                        <p className="health_p">
                            Both players have a health bar, which takes
                            damage upon unsuccessful defending phases.
                            When your health is damaged, you will hear
                            an indicating sound as well.
                            You start with 10 health points, and reaching
                            0 will spell defeat for you, so take care to
                            defend precisely, and make sure to attack
                            with confusing patterns.
                        </p>
